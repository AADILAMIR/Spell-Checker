In this lab we have learned about Z-transform. 
We also came to know that when we use ztrans command then in which our first parameter should be signal for which we perform Z transform and he second should always be he independent variable otherwise we get incorrect result.
There exists a region of convergence for which the z transform is finite for a range of z values.
In this lab we implement different properties of Z transforms and plot them on MATLAB to verify our results.
We also perform convolution on two signals and then take their Z-transform according to our task.
In this lab we learn about IIR and FIR. We have implemented both in our lab tasks using mathematical equation and we perform them theoretically also.
We also learnt how to manipulate and design digital filters.
